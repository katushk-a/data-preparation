# data-preparation

In this Repository I have worked on three questions, the main purpose of which is to prepare data and clean it, so that it has Tidy Format. I did it using Alteryx Designer tool, and then I made simple visualisations using Tableau. 
Here are the questions:
Question 1: The data contains monthly passenger movement data between January 1990 and April 2004 in USA. Merge the data into one data source, plot simple graphs and compare the travel patterns between automobile, train and Air travel. Hint: Look at September 11 terrorist attack.
Question 2: The data contains WHO data on Tuberculosis across the world. Merge the data (before and after year 2000) and convert it into a tidy data format. Shortly report your findings on Afghanistan, Norway, and India.
Question 3: The data contains temperature measured on certain days of the month. Convert the data into a tidy data format, plot simple graphs and discuss monthly patterns. Make suitable assumptions.
